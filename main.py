"""
First algorithm to be implemented will be BFS
1. The maze will be represented by a matrix
2. Starting point will be S
3. Goal will be F
4. visited paths will be +
5. walls will be X
6. Final path will be "P"
7. Unvisited nodes will be 0

BFS works as follows:
Visit all neighbors that hasent been visited
then visit their neighbours etc

Will implement this with a queue
